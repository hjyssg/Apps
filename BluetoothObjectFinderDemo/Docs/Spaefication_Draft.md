##Spefication  

##background process
* detect if there is bluetooth sticker around
* connect to to them if they are registered
* get data and calculate location

###user features
* a list of all beacon items that have active signals around
* a seperate page to help use to find the sticker(a radar-like interface, maybe)
* last-location for lost items, shows on google map
* store and send record for brain research via the internet




###Question

* where can we read the sdk api
* when we get the stiker 
* should the app connect to devices whenever their signals are available or let user to choose
